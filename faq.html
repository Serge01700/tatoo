                <h4>Your Questions - FAQ </h4>
                <h5>How long does it take to get a tattoo?</h5>
                <p>The time it takes to complete a tattoo depends on its size, complexity and the area of the body
                    involved. On average, a small tattoo can take from 1 to 2 hours, while a larger tattoo may require
                    several sessions.</p>



                <h5>Does the tattoo hurt?</h5>
                <p>The sensation of pain varies from person to person, but most people describe a tingling sensation or
                    discomfort during the process. The level of pain also depends on the area of the body where the
                    tattoo is performed.</p>



                <h5>How to choose the right tattoo artist?</h5>
                <p>Take the time to research and consult the portfolios of different tattoo artists. Make sure they have
                    experience in the style of tattooing you're looking for. Read reviews from previous customers to get
                    an idea of their reputation.</p>



                <h5> What post-tattoo care is recommended?</h5>
                <p>After a tattoo has been applied, it's essential to follow the care instructions provided by the
                    tattoo artist. This may include regular cleaning, application of a healing ointment, and avoidance
                    of prolonged exposure to the sun.</p>



                <h5>How long does it take to heal a tattoo?</h5>
                <p>Tattoo healing can take from a few weeks to a few months. The length of time depends on the size of
                    the tattoo, its location and how quickly your skin heals.</p>




                <h5>Can I bring in a custom tattoo idea?</h5>
                <p>Yes, you can! Many tattoo artists accept personalized ideas. Bring visual references or sketches to
                    discuss your vision with the tattoo artist and collaborate on a unique design.</p>



                <h5>What are the risks associated with tattoos?</h5>
                <p>Tattoos carry certain risks, such as infections and allergic reactions. By following care
                    instructions and choosing a reputable professional, you can reduce these risks.
                </p>



                <h5> Do all tattoos require retouching?</h5>
                <p>Touch-ups are not always necessary, but they may be recommended to improve the color or detail of the
                    tattoo. It depends on the type of tattoo and how your skin reacts.
                </p>



                <h5> Can I get a tattoo if I'm pregnant or breast-feeding?</h5>
                <p>Tattooing is generally not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding, due to the potential risks
                    involved. Consult your health care professional before making any decisions.</p>


                <h5>How can I make an appointment with a tattoo artist?</h5>
                <p>Contact the tattooist of your choice directly by phone, email or via their website. Most tattoo
                    artists require a deposit to reserve a date.</p>
